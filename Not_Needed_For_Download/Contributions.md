# Contributing to this repo
Thank you for taking the time to help improve my project!
This is a relatively simple repo, so there are not many possible buggy areas to address. Usually, the only real issues to be found could be in [encrypt_logs.py](https://github.com/alphahunter15/UCSB-CCS-Computing/blob/main/encrypt_logs.py).
### Directions for Reporting a problem
Please be detailed!

It is very helpful if I can understand completely the problem occuring. For example, some helpful information would be:
* What OS you are using
* What command you were trying to run
* The path you took to get to that command
* What probelm you ran into
* If you understand the problem, a possible fix

Also, pull requests are always helpful and welcome.

Any kind of input is welcome and greatly appreciated, even if not in the aforementioned format. Thank you again for contributing!

If you have any specific questions or comments feel free to email me at <isaiahseals5@gmail.com>
